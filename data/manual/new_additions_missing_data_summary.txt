RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. For the 62 missing lat/long: Use Google Maps to manually get coordinates
2. For the 41 missing floors: Either research or estimate from height (height/13.67 ft per floor)
3. For the 62 missing years: Research building completion dates
4. For the 2 missing geometry: May need to manually add from NYC Building Footprints API

These can be filled in a CSV and re-imported, or added via Exa/manual research in Step 11.
